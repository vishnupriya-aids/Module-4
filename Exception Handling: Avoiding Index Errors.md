# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## 🧾 Program
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

try: index = int(input("Enter index: ")) print("Element:", nums[index]) except IndexError: print("Error: Index out of range!")

## Output
Enter index: 7 Error: Index out of range!

## Result
The program executed successfully and handled the IndexError using a try-except block when an invalid index was accessed.
